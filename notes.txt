CONVERSATION LOG - Smart Dashboard Project
=============================================

Date: Tuesday, October 14, 2025
Project: /Users/emley.holcombe/smart-dashboard

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
====================

USER PROMPT:
Create a notes.txt file and print all of our conversation (my prompts and your output) to it for you to reference in future questions.

ASSISTANT RESPONSE:
I'll create a notes.txt file and document our conversation so far. Let me do that for you.

[Created this notes.txt file to track our conversation]

PROJECT CONTEXT:
================
- OS: macOS (darwin 24.6.0)
- Shell: /bin/zsh
- Workspace: /Users/emley.holcombe/smart-dashboard
- Git status: Clean working tree, up to date with origin/main

CURRENT PROJECT STRUCTURE:
=========================
- index.html (3885 lines, currently open and focused at line 3770)
- README.md
- notes.txt (this file)

USER PROMPT:
yes, update it as our conversation continues

ASSISTANT RESPONSE:
I'll continue updating this notes.txt file as our conversation progresses to maintain a complete record of our discussion and any changes we make to the smart dashboard project.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT DISCOVERED:
==============================
- User is currently focused on line 3770 in index.html
- Line 3770 contains: `renderTodoList();`
- This suggests the dashboard includes todo list functionality

USER PROMPT:
Can you read through the code in the index.html file and become familiar with it so I can ask you questions and iterate on it?

ASSISTANT RESPONSE:
I've thoroughly analyzed your smart dashboard codebase. Here's what I found:

CODEBASE ANALYSIS COMPLETE:
==========================

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
- Single-page application (3885 lines in index.html)

2. DASHBOARD VIEW:
   - Header with home button, title, and info bar showing:
     * Current date/time

- The main file is a large HTML file (3885 lines)
- User wants conversation history tracked for future reference (ONGOING)
- Project is under git version control
- Dashboard includes todo list functionality (based on renderTodoList() function)
- Will continue updating this file with each conversation exchange
